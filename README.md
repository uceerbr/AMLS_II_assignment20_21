# AMLS II Assignment 20 / 21 [![Badge License]][License]
*A research project for **AMLS II** |* `ELEC0135`

<br>

The **[Project Script]** details the <br>
parameters for training as well <br>
as testing the agent against the <br>
semi - random opponent.

<br>

Just for fun, I also included an <br>
**[Alternate Version]** with which <br>
the user can play either as the <br>
agent or opponent.

<br>

## Requirements

### Model

Both scripts need access to the **DQN** model in the directory:

`Source/Trainings_500Ktraining/models4/dqn_training_reducedLossPenalty`

<br>

### Libraries

My environment had the **[These Libraries]** installed.
